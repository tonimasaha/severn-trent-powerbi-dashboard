# Core DAX Measures (Portfolio)

This document summarises the key DAX measures used across the dashboard. Measures are grouped by analytical purpose and are designed to support executive reporting, operational analysis, and risk monitoring.

## Work Orders

- WO Total  
  Counts all work orders in the current filter context.
  ```DAX
  WO Total =
  COUNTROWS ( FactWorkOrder )

- WO Completed =
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( FactWorkOrder ),
    FactWorkOrder[Status] = "Completed"
)

- WO Completion Rate % =
DIVIDE ( [WO Completed], [WO Total] )

- WO Backlog (Open) =
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( FactWorkOrder ),
    FactWorkOrder[Status] = "Open"
)

- WO Revisit Rate % =
DIVIDE (
    CALCULATE (
        COUNTROWS ( FactWorkOrder ),
        FactWorkOrder[IsRevisit] = TRUE()
    ),
    [WO Total]
)


## SLA
- SLA Events Total =
COUNTROWS ( FactSLAEvent )

- SLA Breaches =
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( FactSLAEvent ),
    FactSLAEvent[IsBreached] = TRUE()
)

- SLA Compliance % =
DIVIDE (
    [SLA Events Total] - [SLA Breaches],
    [SLA Events Total]
)

- SLA Breach Rate % =
DIVIDE ( [SLA Breaches], [SLA Events Total] )


## Trends & Risk
- SLA Breaches (Rolling 3M) =
CALCULATE (
    [SLA Breaches],
    DATESINPERIOD (
        DimDate[Date],
        MAX ( DimDate[Date] ),
        -3,
        MONTH
    )
)

- SLA Risk Status =
IF (
    [SLA Breaches (Rolling 3M)] > 2000,
    "High Risk",
    "Acceptable"
)

- WO Backlog (Trend) =
CALCULATE (
    COUNTROWS ( FactWorkOrder ),
    FactWorkOrder[Status] = "Open"
)
